# Intro to VR Assignment 1: Space & Time
Implementation of a mock-up of SUPER HOT in VR. Made in Unity using the Meta Quest 3. When opening project in Unity, make sure to select and open the main scene in the scenes folder. For some reason, Unity defaults to loading an empty scene instead of the scene that was worked on.
